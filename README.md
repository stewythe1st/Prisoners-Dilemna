# Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma

A Coevolutionary Genetic Programming Approach.

### Makes Use of

The following third party libraries and specifications were used.

* C++11
* Kasper Peters' [tree.hh library](http://tree.phi-sci.com/index.html)

### Running

Use the included ```run.sh``` to compile and run the program. You will need to supply the configuration file as an argument. If no specific configuration file is supplied, it will assume ```default.cfg```.

```bash
./run.sh cfg/default.cfg
```

### Output

The program will output the following. The filepath of each in configurable in the passed .cfg file.

* Log File```(example.txt)``` - Prints configuration information, then a series of tab-delimited rows detailing run information.
* Log CSV```(example.csv)``` - Logs all per-generation data to a csv for analysis.
* Log CSV```(example_best.csv)``` - Logs data about each run's final best population.
* Standard Out - Mirrors the logfile.
* Solution File - Prints the best agent's tree in pre-order format.
